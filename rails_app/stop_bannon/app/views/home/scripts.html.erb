<h3>For Democratic Senators and Representatives:</h3>
<p>
  “Hello, my name is [your name]. I am a constituent, living in [address, district]. I am horrified at the news of Trump appointing Steve Bannon, a white supremacist, as one of his closest advisors. Please publicly condemn this appointment”
</p>
<p>
  “Hello, I am your constituent from [your location] and I was wondering when [legislator’s name] was planning on releasing a statement condemning Steve Bannon, the white supremacist who Donald Trump has appointed as his chief strategist.” (from @foundbysara)
</p>
<p>
  “Does [legislator’s name] agree with Harry Reid that Bannon’s appointment sends a dangerous signal that white supremacists “will be represented at the highest levels” in Trump’s administration? If so, please publicly condemn this appointment immediately.”
</p>
<p>
  “I am frightened by this as a [woman, as a Jewish person, as a Muslim person, as a black person, a queer person, etc.] American and I am asking [legislator’s name] to speak out against this appointment immediately, to make it clear that this is not acceptable. Can [legislator’s name] commit to standing with Harry Reid and speaking out publicly?”
</p>
<p>
  If the person responds that the representative has no intention of condemning Bannon, say, “I will call back tomorrow.” And call back tomorrow.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  “How does [legislator’s name] feel about this appointment? Does this appointment represent his/her views? I am frightened by this [woman, as a Jewish person, as a Muslim person, as a black person, a queer person, etc.] and I am asking [legislator’s name] to speak out against this appointment immediately, to make it clear that this is not OK with mainstream Republicans.”
</p>
<p>
